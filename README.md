#Gigger is a job recruitment app that you can use to see how to use the latest React Native Techniques

Which version of the app is determined by changing a global, from 'user' to 'boss'. It's also a great template for a 'vanilla' or 'white-label' app, that can be modified for other oportunities, e.g. a dating app, insurance claim app, teaching app...

To get started and use the app 'as is' you need a Google Firestore database. Once set up, make sure you add the config files.

What you can do? Examples:

1.  Form validation with React-Hook-Form
2.  Using Appium and writing tests in Cucumber
3.  Connecting to Firestore
4.  Reading Firestore with React-Native-Firestore
5.  Using React-Navigation v5
6.  Authentication flow in React Navigation
7.  Use of useContext for authentication and to prevent prop-drilling
